## Suggestions:
* It is important to understand overall unrest in Kenya, as it is the greatest predictor of farming related conflict
* However, if we only considered models that included only climatic data (i.e., removing the total conflicts data), we find that the top climatic model is a temperature trend for the Kenya-wide analysis and the precipitation only model for the Trans Nzoia Analysis (See *models in Table 1). 
  - This may indicate that at a finer spatial scale, precipitation drives farming related conflict more than temperature. 

## Considerations:
* Analysis for this project was quick and brief, a further dive into existing and future data is needed (see next steps below)

## Next steps:
* Future model analysis:
  - Build a spatial-temporal time series model that performs the analysis for >1 county
  - Incorporate land cover and rainfed crop data as additional model covariates

* Future data analysis (from existing data)
  - Better disentangle farming and herder related conflicts in the large conflict data file 
  - Check that the correct spatial extent is expressed in all data sources
  - Understand whether adjacent countries are experiencing similar farming-herding conflicts and if that fuels unrest in Kenya

* Future data analysis (from other data sources)
  - Obtain fine-scale information on where herding and farming occurs in Kenya
  - Obtain other covariate data (e.g., irrigation data, agricultural policy change data,  agriculture production data, etc.)
